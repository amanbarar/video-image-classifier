# video-image-classifier

## Project Outcome:

The objective of the project is getting hands-on experience on image processing and computer vision. The work would include a complete pipeline from creation of dataset, preprocessing to actual deployment of models and testing. 
Project Task:

The task to solve a classification problem where we classify each image extracted from videos into 3 classes. In machine learning this is called multi label classification. The classes are as follows: Eye contact, Smile and Dressing.


### Step 1: Video Processing Using Label Box
Labelbox annotation tutorial video: [Tutorial for Annotations on the Label Box](https://www.loom.com/share/d4b2dafb3d0540f3978b94041fa7eac4?sid=1d2f0a3e-c1ef-45db-9a58-11d46f81f0e8)

### Step 2: Preprocessing and Data Preparation
- Extract all data from Labelbox JSON output files and generate csv files with annotation of labels
- Make csv files and images pre processed and ready for model training and testing 

### Step 3: Model Training and Testing

- Understand what happens in CNN models for image processing.
- Send in the right inputs for CNN models from images and train models.
- Check for model performance at testing using mentioned metrics and understand why model performance is possibly less.
- Repeat the process with changes in model (hyper parameter tuning).
